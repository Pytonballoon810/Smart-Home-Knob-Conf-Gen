# Smart Home Knob Conf Gen

A quick and dirty app to generate configuration files for the [Smart Home Knob](https://github.com/scottbez1/smartknob) from scottbez1.

This is meant to be used with my [Smart Home Knob Fork](https://github.com/Pytonballoon810/Smart-Home-Knob) which adds support for mqtt dynamic configuration.
